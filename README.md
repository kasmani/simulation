Computes future value of investments invested for duration of 20 years based on given expected rate of return and risk tolerance. Approach uses Monte Carlo Simulation strategy using 10,000 simulation taking 3.5% annual inflation into account to come up with the investment value at the end of the period under consideration.

The solution can be tested through InvestmentReturnSimulator class under com.anis.investment.simulation package. The main method
in this class defines two portfolios, Aggressive and Conservative, to model two scenarios to compare. Initial investment amount
for the two portfolios is $100,000. Aggressive portfolio expects rate of return of 9.4324% on investments and allows for 
acceptable risk of 15.675%. In comparison, the conservative portfolio expects rate of return of 6.189% and acceptable rate of return of 6.3438%.
